# Solar-Tracker
Designed a dual-axis solar tracking system that detects light intensity using analog sensors and adjusts panel position via closed-loop motor control using a K64 FRDM board. Integrated ADC for sensor input and GPIO for motor actuation; validated performance with oscilloscope-based signal analysis.
